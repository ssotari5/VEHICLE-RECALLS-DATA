S001,3001,Suspension,"TORQUE RELAXATION OF TRACK ROD AND RETAINING NUT CAN CAUSE KNOCK OR VIBRATION FROM THE SUSPENSION AND STEERING.
CORRECTION: NEW NUTS WERE FITTED ON AFFECTED VEHICLES PRIOR TO RETAIL SALE."
S002,3002,Brakes,"On certain vehicles, the Anti-lock Brake System / Vehicle Dynamic Control (ABS/VDC) actuator was assembled with more than one ball bearing in the valve.  This could cause fluid flow to be blocked, resulting in a reduction in brake force in one or both front wheels.   This could increase the vehicle's stopping distance and cause a crash with injury or death.  Correction: Dealers will replace the ABS/VDC actuator.  Note: All vehicles were captured before retail sale."
S003,3003,Engine,"On certain ATVs, operated in sub-freezing temperatures, for repeated short-run periods of time, excess moisture may collect and freeze in the outlet port of the crankcase ventilation valve assembly.  If this occurs, a restriction of crankcase ventilation to the air box could cause an increase of crankcase pressure leading to valve cover gasket displacement and engine oil leakage.  Should an oil leak at the valve cover occur, oil could contact the exhaust header pipe and create a fire hazard, which could result in property damage, personal injury or death.  Correction: Dealers will install a crankcase breather kit."
S004,3004,Suspension,"On certain ATVs, the front suspension steering knuckles may not have been manufactured to specifications.  Oversized ball joint stem mounting holes and oversized pinch bolt through holes may cause a reduction in the clamp force required to retain the ball joint stems in the steering knuckle.  As a result, the upper or lower control arm assemblies could become disconnected from the steering knuckle.  This could cause a loss of steering control and a crash resulting in property damage, personal injury or death.  Correction: Dealers will affect repairs."

S011,3011,Electrical,"This recall was replaced by Transport Canada Recall No. 2022-607. 

On certain vehicles, the connector pins within the Hydraulic Electronic Control Unit (HECU) assembly can corrode due to improper sealing of the HECU's wire harness cover. If moisture and road salt reaches the HECU's circuit board, electrical short circuits may occur to the circuit board, which could increase the risk of an underhood fire causing injury and/or property damage. Correction: Dealers will inspect the connector pins of the HECU for corrosion. If no corrosion is identified, dealers will replace the connector cover with a new one. If corrosion is present, dealers will replace the HECU assembly and connector cover with a new one. Note: The presence of salt water in the HECU does not affect brake performance."
